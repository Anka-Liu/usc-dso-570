The direction of the objective function is the vector $(F,C)=(12000,13000)$, which is toward the north east in the graph below (slightly more north than east because $13000>12000$). Hence, the optimal solution is the intersection of the general assembly constraint and the electric assembly constraint. (These two are the binding constraints at the optimal solution.)

    "As can be seen from the solution, the optimal solution is not using all the capacity for Canton (where the production cost is the highest), and this plant is only serving Treble, for which it has a good transportation cost. Furthermore, all of the demand from Dean is being served from Binghamton, which serves no other manufacturer. Arlington, the plant where the production cost is the lowest, is used to satisfy demand from a variety of manufacturers, and is the most valuable resource. Increasing capacity at Arlington by 1 motor/month would reduce total costs by 6 dollars, where as increasing capacity at Binghamton by 1 motor/month would reduce total cost only by 1 dollar. Increasing capacity at Canton is not helpful at this point as we are not even using all of the current capacity."
