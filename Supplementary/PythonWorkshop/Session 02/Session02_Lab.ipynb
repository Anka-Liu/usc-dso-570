    "\n",
    "3. Update the previous code so that the program keeps taking input from the user until they get the input \"MSBA\", however, it treats lines that start with the hash character (#) as lines not to be printed (kind of like Python comments)\n",

    "8. Rewrite the function the computes the average of a list of numbers entered by the user using a list.\n",
    "9. (Homework) Write a Python function that checks if a given string is a palindrome. e.g. \"radar\" is palindrom because if you read it backwords, it is still radar. (\"eye\", \"12321\", \"A nut for a jar of tuna\").\n"
