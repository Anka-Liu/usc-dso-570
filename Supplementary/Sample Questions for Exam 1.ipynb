    "## Sample Question\n",
    "\n",
    "Riya is in her second semester in the USC business analytics program. She has been applying to summer internships and has received an offer from a data analyst position at Disney. However, she has to respond to this offer in one week, while she has an interview at Google in a month, which will be after her Disney deadline. While Google is her dream company, she may not get an offer from them, and Disney is a sure place where she can sharpen her data analytics skills for the summer. She has to decide whether or not to take the Disney offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "If she rejects the Disney internship, then she estimates there's a 50% chance she will succeed in the Google interview and get an internship, and a 50% chance she will not, at which point she may have to settle for a second-tier company to do an internship. She estimates that her utility (i.e. level of happiness) for the summer internship at Google is 10, her utility for the internship at Disney is 8, and her utility for second-tier companies is normalized to 0. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, she does not only care about her utility for the summer, but also for after graduation. In other words, **her total utility (on which she is basing the current decision) is the sum of her summer utility plus her post-graduation utility.** Currently Google is her dream company for full time job, and she estimates that there's a 80% chance she is a good fit for the company, for which her post-graduation utility would be 100 if she works there. If she is not a good fit, then her post-graduation utility is -50 for working there (as she would have to forego other full-time opportunities). One benefit of doing a Google internship this summer is to figure out whether she is a good fit. She estimates that if she did an internship at Google this summer, she would know for certain whether or not she is a good fit there, so is able to better make the post-graduation application decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Her dilemma is as follows. If she takes the internship at Disney, then she would get a summer utility of 8, plus she still plans to apply for a full-time position at Google later. Her experience at Disney would give her a 60% chance of getting the full time offer at Google (but she doesn't know whether she would be a good fit so would have to bear the above risk for her post-graduation utility). If she applies for a Google full time position and does not get in, then her post-graduation utility would be 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "If she rejects the internship at Disney, then if she gets into Google, she will obtain the summer utility of 10, plus the knowledge of whether she is a good fit for the company. If she is a good fit, then she is sure she would get the full time position, and so obtain a post-graduation utility of 100. If she is not a good fit, then she has time to prepare for other companies, and get a post-graduation utility of 20. If she rejects Disney and doesn't get the Google internship, then she gets a summer utility of zero, after which she will reapply for Google. She estimates the chance of getting a Google full-time offer after a second-tier summer internship would be 40%. If she gets in, she bears the aforementioned risk on her post-graduation utility (based on whether she is a good fit for Google). If she does not get in, she obtains a post-graduation utility of zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "a) Draw a decision tree to capture the uncertainties and sequential decisions described above. (Use rectangles for decision nodes, ovals for event nodes, and blank for outcome nodes.) (10 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Write the values of each outcomes and probabilities for each event node on the tree. (10 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "c) Solve the decision tree and write down her expected utility for accepting and rejecting the Disney internship respectively. (5 points)\n",

    "In this question, you will write code to complete an analysis of the distribution of times before the tickets for a certain event sells out. USC is selling 400 tickets to a special event. The selling starts 8 weeks before the event takes place. Demand for any particular event is uncertain:\n",

    "The input parameter `data` is a list containing the number of requests for beds for each day. For example, `data=[6,10,3,8,4,6]` denotes that 6 patients requested beds on first day, 10 on the second day, and 3 on the third day, and so on. The parameter `beds` is the total number of beds in this ward. In the example below, there are 15 beds in total. `stay` is the number of days each patient stays in the ward. In the example below, `stay=3`, in which case you can assume that every patient stays for exactly 3 days and leave in the early morning on the 4th day since arrival. \n",
    "\n",
    "Initially the beds are all empty. As patients come in, beds are assigned from a first come first serve basis. When a patient requests a bed and none is available, then that patient is rejected from the ward. The return value of the function is the total number of rejected patients. \n",

    "In the numerical example above, the number of beds available is first 15. Then after day 1, it becomes 15-6=9. After day 2, all beds are taken and 10-9=1 patient is rejected. On day 3, all 3 patients are rejected because the patients from day 1 haven't left yet. On day 4, all 6 admitted patients from day 1 leave in the early morning and 6 beds are emptied up. Hence, 6 out of the 8 patients who come on day 4 get beds, and 2 are rejected. On day 5, the 9 patients from day 2 all leave, and all 4 patients who come in get beds, and there are now 5 empty beds. On day 6, no patient leaves because on day 3 none were admitted, and there are 5 empty beds, so 1 patient gets rejected.\n",
