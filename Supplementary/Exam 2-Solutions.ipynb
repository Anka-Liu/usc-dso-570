For example, consider the following map, which has 5 intersections (A, B, C, D, E) and 5 segment (A-B, A-C, C-D, B-D, C-E, and D-E).

(Although larger boxes have higher variable costs to make, using only larger boxes allows the company to make do with fewer box types, and lower the total fixed cost.
