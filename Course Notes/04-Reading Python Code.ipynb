    "## FAQ: \n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** In the example above, why do we not use `range(len(l)-1)`, since python counts from 0?\n",
    "\n",
    "A: `range(4)=[0,1,2,3]` already, so this is taken into account by how the `range` is defined in Python. If we had used `range(len(l)-1)` or `range(3)`, we would only get `[0,1,2]`. The fact that `range(a,b)=[a,a+1,...,b-1]` rather than up to `b` is a confusing part of the language, but as with any language there are quirks one must get used to.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** What is the meaning of \"pseudo-code\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "A: The word pseudo means \"fake,\" so pseudocode is not really correct code in terms of commands that computer can run, but an algorithm written using *computer logic but human words*. However, the hardest part of programming is generally translating the task into \"computer thinking,\" and from pseudocode it is simply a matter of Googling the correct syntax to turn it into real code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** When should we use Jupyter notebook versus Spyder?\n",
    "\n",
    "A: Jupyter notebook is ideal if we would like to share the result with another. You can simply send the .ipynb file and the other can read it. It also allows writing cells in \"markdown,\" which is not Python code but allows easy text formating. (All the course notes and homeworks are written using Jupyter notebooks.) The drawback is that it cannot edit a .py file, so we have to put all of the code into the boxes. Spyder is for developing a more serious application, with potentially many files. It has multiple windows, one console for running (like Jupyter notebook), and one for editing files."
