    "# Final Project Discussion (2/8)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Objectives:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Describe what \"good\" means for each stakeholder in the Marshall course scheduling case. (Model)\n",
    "- Identify appropriate metrics/analyses to measure each notion of \"goodness.\" (Model)\n",
    "- Disecting, explaining and modifying the Python code in Lab 2 solutions. (Code)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Project material posted on Blackboard:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Overview of project and deliverables (more detailed description of each deliverable and grading rubric will be posted with the submission link.) (Assignments tab)\n",
    "- Currently available data sets and description of data. (Assignments tab)\n",
    "- Visuals used by Shannon and Hal in their in-class discussion. (Content tab)\n",
    "- Team assignment spreadsheet. (Assignments tab)\n",
    "- Free supplementary resources on basic Python. (Content tab)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Defining and Measuring \"Goodness\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In-class exercise: \n",
    "\n",
    "Identify what a good outcome of the scheduling system looks like to each of the following stakeholders: students, faculty, program, department, management (i.e. Marshall leadership, USC registrar, finance office).\n",
    "\n",
    "For each outcome, find an appropriate metric or analysis to quantify or visualize it from data. The exact form of this is open ended: for example, it can be in the form of a single number for each stakeholder, or in the form of a graph or visual that illustrates the outcome. Essentially, any output of a data analysis counts. When conducting prescriptive analytics, a good metric/analysis for an outcome is CASE:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Computable** from available data and reasonable supplemental assumptions (in cases when certain data could be collected but is currently unavailable, you may fill in the gap for now by reasonable assumption.) \n",
    "- **Actionable**: within our power to affect. For example, the number of classes scheduled in late evenings is within our power to affect, but not the number of PM MBA students or the number of students who have full time jobs.\n",
    "- **Simple** to understand and interpret. Since there are many stakeholders, it is important that the analysis is transparent and understandable.\n",
    "- **Enlightening** for the underlying outcome one is measuring. There should be a close relationship with the underlying outcome to be measured. For example, if the outcome is high utilization of 11-5pm slots, then a good metric in this category would be the percentage of times that is used up on average in JKP, but a bad metric would be the average number of classes that take place in JKP during this time, since classes have variable lengths and one can have many short classes but still have large gaps of free time in between. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning from Code Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "When stumbling across unfamiliar code examples, the following steps can be taken to digest the example and learn from it. It has the acronym DEMO:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **D**isect the code and break it up into small chunks, and \"look inside\" the working of the code by printing intermediary computations and looking up Python help or online documentation.\n",
    "- **E**xplain in your own words what each small chunk of code does and what the overall piece of code does.\n",
    "- **MO**dify each small chunk of code and apply it in new contexts, so as to make this coding construction your own. (It's like learning new vocabulary from example sentences.)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Digesting Lab 2 Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "We apply these steps to learn from the Lab 2 solutions: http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/pengshi46/usc-dso-570/blob/master/Labs/Lab2/Lab%202-Solution.ipynb?flush_cache=true You can click this to open in a new browser and refer to it when needed.\n",

So `distN1.rvs()` draws one random number from the `distN1=norm(200,60)` distribution (normal distribution with mean 200 and stdev 60). When specifying the `size` parameter, this generates an array of independent random samples with the given size. The `max(0, )` command makes sure that the number of customers of segment 1 is not negative, and the `int( )` command rounds down the fractional number into an integer.\n",

We increment in unit of 5 because the problem assumed that the price will be a multiple of 5. You could have searched over a larger range but the optimal answer is contained in this range.

As discussed in session 1, this strategy for optimization (trying every possibility) is called enumeration. In order for it to run in a reasonable time, we have to constrain the set of options to try, which we did here by making `analyzeRM2` search around the optimum of `analyzeRM1`. "
