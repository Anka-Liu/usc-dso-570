    "One powerful technique in LP/MIP modeling is to create additional decision variables to make it easier to formulate the objective or constraints. These variables are called **auxiliary decision variables** because they not necessary to encode the decision (hence \"auxiliary\") and their numerical value is not known in advance (hence they are decision variables, not inputs). We illustrate their use via a few examples.\n",

    "To ensure that the company’s portfolio is diversified, Finco required that at most \\$75,000 be placed in any single investment option. Returns from investments can be reinvested in the same year. For example, the positive cash flow received from Option C in Year 1 can be reinvested immediately in Option B. However, Finco cannot borrow funds, so net cash on hand must be non-negative in all years. Formulate this as an optimization problem.\n",

There are tractable special cases of non-linear optimization problems, but they require certain particular mathematical structure, which real world business problems seldomly satisfy. Your main strategy for tackling non-linear optimization problems should be to define extra decision variables to convert it to a linear problem as above, or to change the problem definition to solve a linear problem instead. \n",
