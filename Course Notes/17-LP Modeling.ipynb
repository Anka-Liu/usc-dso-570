    "## Clarifying Shadow Prices\n",
    "\n",
    "You do not need to calculate shadow prices by hand. They are automatically computed by the LP solver. The formula from last class are to help you understand what the number represents.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each shadow price, the **Allowable Range** (obtained in Gurobi by `c.SARHSLow` and `c.SARHSUp`, where `c` is the constraint object), tells you what is the minimum and maximum Right Hand Side (RHS) of the constraint in which the shadow price is valid. Within this range, if the shadow price is $p$, a $\\delta$ change in the RHS of the constraint results in a $p\\delta$ change in the value of the objective. For example, if the constraint is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{Material 1:} \\qquad 4X+Y <= 60$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And the shadow price is $3.33$ and the allowable range is $[48,120]$, then a 10 unit increase in results in an increase in the optimal objective value by $33.3$ (holding all other constraints fixed). A 10 unit decrease results in a decrease of $33.3$. We do not know what happens with a 70 unit increase, because $60+70=130$ lies outside the allowable range.\n",
    "\n",
    "The allowable range is calculated by the LP solver based on what the RHS of the constraint must be before the set of binding constraints changes. When a previously non-binding constraint becomes binding, or when a previously binding constraint becomes non-binding, the shadow price changes. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Creative LP Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have the production planning $LP$ with 3 decision variables $X$, $Y$, $Z$, corresponding to the amount produced of each of the three types of products.\n",

    "The above LP maximizes profit (20,10,and 30 are the profit from selling each of unit of $X$, $Y$, and $Z$), subject to not using more material than available. Product $X$ requires 4 units of material 1, and 1 hour of labor, etc. In this section, we illustrate modeling tricks to modify the above LP to model other scenarios, using only linear constraints and objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Maximizing the minimum of certain decision variables\n",
    "Suppose $X$, $Y$, $Z$ are three ingredients of a meal, and we need each meal to be balanced, meaning that each meal contains 1 unit of each product. Suppose we want to maximize the number of balanced meals produced, instead of maximizing the profit as before. In other words, we want to maximize the non-linear function $\\min(X,Y,Z)$, subject to the material and labor constraints as before. To do this, we define a new decision variable $L$ denoting the number of balanced meals produced. ($L$ stands for \"lower-bound,\" as it must lower bound the three other decision variables.) This can be achieved as follows.\n",

    "\n",
    "Here, the \"Lower bound\" constraint is 3 constraints: $X \\ge L$, $Y \\ge L$, $Z \\ge L$. These three constraints make sure that the number of balanced meals is not more than the number of each of the three necessary ingredients. This recipe essentially changes the previous LP to maximize the non-linear objective $\\min(X,Y,Z)$, but do so while staying within what's allowed in a LP. The same idea can be used to minimize the maximum of a set of variables.\n",
