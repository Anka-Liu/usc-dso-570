    "Finco Investment Corporation wishes to determine an investment strategy for the firm for the next 3 years. At present (Year 0), $100,000$ is available for investment. The goal is to maximize the cash on hand at the end of Year 3. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are five investment options, labeled $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, and $E$. The cash flow associated with investing \\$1 in each investment is given in the table below. \n",

    "For example, Option A must be invested this year, and each dollar of cash outflow now returns \\$0.50 in Year 1 and one dollar in Year 2. Option E mst be invested in Year 2 and each dollar returns \\$1.50 the next year.\n",

    "To ensure that the company’s portfolio is diversified, Finco required that at most \\$75,000 be placed in any single investment option. Returns from investments can be reinvested in the same year. For example, the positive cash flow received from Option C in Year 1 can be reinvested immediately in Option B. However, Finco cannot borrow funds, so net cash on hand must be non-negative in all years. Formulate this as an optimization problem.\n",
